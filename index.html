    <h2><em>Origin:</em></h3>
    <p>For many decades, the precise taxonomic classification of the <b>Giant panda</b> was under debate because it shares characteristics with both bears and raccoons.However, molecular studies indicate the giant panda is a true bear, part of the family Ursidae.<br>These studies show it diverged about <i>19 million years ago</i> from the common ancestor of the Ursidae; it is the most basal member of this family and equidistant from all other extant bear species .The giant panda has been referred to as a living fossil.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2><em>Ecology:</em></h3>
    <p>The word panda was borrowed into English from French, but no conclusive explanation of the origin of the French word panda has been found. The closest candidate is the Nepali word ponya, possibly referring to the adapted wrist bone of the red panda, which is native to Nepal. The Western world originally applied this name to the red panda.</p>
    <p>In many older sources, the name "panda" or "common panda" refers to the lesser-known red panda, thus necessitating the inclusion of "giant" and "lesser/red" prefixes in front of the names. <mark>Even in 2013, the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica still used "giant panda" or "panda bear" for the bear,and simply "panda" for the red panda.</mark>despite the popular usage of the word "panda" to refer to giant pandas.</p>

    <h2><em>Panda Life in Zoo:</em></h3>
    <p>Pandas have been kept in zoos as early as <b>the Western Han Dynasty in China</b>, where the writer Sima Xiangru noted that the panda was the most treasured animal in the emperor's garden of exotic animals in the capital Chang'an (present Xi'an). Not until the 1950s were pandas again recorded to have been exhibited in China's zoos. Chi Chi at the London Zoo became very popular. This influenced the World Wildlife Fund to use a panda as its symbol.</p>
    <p>A 2006 New York Times article outlined the economics of keeping pandas, which costs five times more than keeping the next most expensive animal, an elephant. American zoos generally pay the Chinese government $1 million a year in fees, as part of a typical ten-year contract. San Diego's contract with China was to expire in 2008, but got a five-year extension at about half of the previous yearly cost.The last contract, with <em>the Memphis Zoo in Memphis, Tennessee,</em> ended in 2013.</p>

    <h2><em>Behaviour:</em></h3>
    <p>The giant panda is a terrestrial animal and primarily spends its life roaming and feeding in the bamboo forests of the Qinling Mountains and in <b>the hilly province of Sichuan</b>. Giant pandas are generally solitary. Each adult has a defined territory and a female is not tolerant of other females in her range.</p>
    <p></p>Social encounters occur primarily during the brief breeding season in which pandas in proximity to one another will gather. After mating, the male leaves the female alone to raise the cub.</p><hr>
    <h2><em>Reproduction:</em></h2>
    <p>Initially, the primary method of breeding giant pandas in captivity was by artificial insemination, as they seemed to lose their interest in mating once they were captured. This led some scientists to try extreme methods, such as showing them videos of giant pandas mating and giving the males sildenafil (commonly known as Viagra).</p>
    <p>Only recently have researchers started having success with captive breeding programs, and they have now determined giant pandas have comparable breeding to some populations of the American black bear, a thriving bear species. The normal reproductive rate is considered to be one young every two years.</p><hr>
